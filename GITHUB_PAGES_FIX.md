# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## âœ… The Issue
Your GitHub Pages was showing the assignment instructions (README.md) instead of your React app because it was building from the `main` branch root directory.

## âœ… The Solution
I've deployed your React app to the `gh-pages` branch. Now you need to update your GitHub Pages settings.

## ðŸ“‹ Steps to Fix in GitHub Settings

1. **Go to your repository settings** (the page you showed in the screenshot)

2. **In the GitHub Pages section, change these settings:**
   - **Source**: Keep "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Change from `main` to `gh-pages`
   - **Folder**: Keep it as `/ (root)`
   
3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild

5. **Visit your site**: https://ucb-info-frontend-webarch.github.io/assignment-2-jayyee23/

## ðŸŽ¯ What Changed

- **Before**: GitHub Pages was serving the README.md from the `main` branch
- **After**: GitHub Pages will serve your built React app from the `gh-pages` branch

## ðŸ“‚ Branch Structure

- **main branch**: Contains your source code and development files
- **gh-pages branch**: Contains only the built/compiled React app (dist folder contents)

## ðŸ”„ Future Deployments

Whenever you make changes to your React app:

```bash
# In the task-manager-react folder
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d dist
```

Or since we added scripts to package.json:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will automatically update the gh-pages branch with your latest changes.

## âœ¨ Result

Your React Task Manager app will be live at:
https://ucb-info-frontend-webarch.github.io/assignment-2-jayyee23/

Instead of showing the assignment instructions, it will show your actual React application!
