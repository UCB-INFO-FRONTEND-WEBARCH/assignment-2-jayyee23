### 3. **Reflection on React vs Vanilla JavaScript** ✅
Included in README.md:
> Working with React provides significant advantages over vanilla JavaScript for building interactive UIs. The component-based architecture makes code more modular and reusable, while the declarative nature of React simplifies complex state management. The virtual DOM ensures efficient updates, and the unidirectional data flow makes the application more predictable and easier to debug.
>
> Compared to Assignment 1's vanilla JavaScript approach, React eliminates manual DOM manipulation, provides better separation of concerns, and makes it easier to manage application state. The development experience is enhanced with hot module replacement, and the component lifecycle is more intuitive than manually managing event listeners and DOM updates.
